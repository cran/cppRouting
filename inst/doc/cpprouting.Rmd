#Package presentation

`cppRouting` is an `R` package which provide functions to calculate distances, shortest paths and isochrones/isodistances on non-negative weighted graphs. 
For now, `cppRouting` can implement :  
  
  - uni-directional Dijkstra algorithm,
  - bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm,
  - uni-directional A* algorithm  
  - New bi-directional A* algorithm (Piljs & Post, 2009 : see http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16100/ei2009-10.pdf)
   
All these functions are written in C++ and use std::priority_queue container from the Standard Template Library.  
This package have been made with `Rcpp` and `parallel` packages.


#Main functions
  
`cppRouting` package provide these functions :  
  
- distance matrix (between all combinations origin-destination nodes),  
- distances between origin and destination by pair,  
- shortest paths between origin and destination by pair,  
- shortest paths between all origin nodes and all destination nodes,  
- Isochrones/isodistances with one or multiple breaks.  
  
The choice between all the algorithms is available for `get_distance_pair` and `get_path_pair`. In these functions, uni-directional Dijkstra algorithm is stopped when the destination node is reached.  
`A*` and `NBA*` are relevant if geographic coordinates of all nodes are provided. Note that coordinates should be expressed in a projection system.  
To be accurate and efficient, `A*` and `NBA*` algorithms should use an admissible heuristic function (here the Euclidean distance), e.g cost and heuristic function must be expressed in the same unit.  
In `cppRouting`, heuristic function `h` is defined such that : h(xi,yi,xdestination,ydestination)/k, with a constant k; so in the case where coordinates are expressed in meters and cost is expressed in time, k is the maximum speed allowed on the road. By default, constant is 1 and is designed for graphs with cost expressed in the same unit than coordinates (e.g meters).  
  
If coordinates cannot be provided, bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm can offer a good alternative to A* in terms of performance.
  

#New algorithms `cppRouting` will provide in the future   
  
- Detours admitting shortest paths : finding the nodes that are reachable under a fixed detour time around the shortest path  
- Graph simplification by removing irrelevant nodes in order to compute in a faster way the  shortest distance or travel time  
- Contraction hierarchies implementation
