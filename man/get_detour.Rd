\title{Return the nodes that can be reached in a detour time set around the shortest path}
\usage{
get_detour(Graph, from, to, extra = NULL, allcores = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Graph}{An object generated by cppRouting::makegraph() function.}

\item{from}{A vector of one or more vertices from which shortest path are calculated (origin).}

\item{to}{A vector of one or more vertices (destination).}

\item{extra}{numeric. Additional cost}

\item{allcores}{Logical. If TRUE, all cores are used.}
}
\value{
List of nodes that can be reached
}
\description{
Return the nodes that can be reached in a detour time set around the shortest path
}
\details{
Each returned nodes \emph{n} meet the following condition : \cr
 \strong{SP(o,n) + SP(n,d) < SP(o,d) + t} \cr
 with \emph{SP} shortest distance/time, \emph{o} the origin node, \emph{d} the destination node and \emph{t} the extra cost.

Modified bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm is ran for each path.
}
\note{
'from' and 'to' must be the same length.
